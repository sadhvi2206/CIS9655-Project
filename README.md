# The Impact of Screen Time on Adolescents and Adults. (8-17 years, 18+ years)
## Hypothesis:
With the rapid integration of digital technology into everyday life, screen time has become a
significant aspect of both adolescent (ages 8–17) and adult (ages 18 and above) routines. Recent
studies show that adolescents spend up to 9 hours daily on screens, while adults average up to 13
hours combining work and personal use. Although screens offer access to education,
communication, and entertainment, prolonged screen exposure has been associated with reduced
cognitive function, disrupted sleep patterns, declining academic performance, and adverse effects
on physical health.

## Approach:
This study analyzes publicly available datasets (sourced from Kaggle) to examine the impact of
screen time on academic performance, sleep quality, and physical activity. The datasets will be
cleaned, merged, and categorized into two groups: adolescents (aged 8–17 years) and adults
(aged 18 years and above).
The study will compare the effects of screen time on adolescents versus adults, aiming to identify
whether younger individuals experience more substantial academic and sleep disruptions. In
contrast, adults experience higher stress and compulsive usage. The findings will provide
valuable insights and practical recommendations for promoting healthier screen time habits.
The analysis includes:
● Data preprocessing and age binning
● Visual exploration of patterns (e.g., screen time vs. grades, sleep, activity)
● Correlation analysis to assess the strength of relationships
